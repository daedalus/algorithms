class Homotopy:
    """
    This class simulates a homotopy between two functions f and g over integers.
    
    Caveat:
        This is only a discrete and finite approximation of homotopy.
        True homotopy in Homotopy Type Theory involves continuous paths and higher
        identity types in type-theoretic or topological spaces.
        This model only checks pointwise equality on a fixed finite domain.
